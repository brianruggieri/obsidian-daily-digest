{{tierInstruction}}You are writing sections of a daily note for a personal knowledge base. Below is a structured summary of today's activity (already processed by code). Your job is to add the human insight layer — narrative, synthesis, and connections that code can't produce.

Write for someone rereading this note 3 months from now. Be specific and concrete — prefer "debugged the OAuth callback race condition" over "did some dev work."{{contextHint}}

Write each section below using the exact heading format shown. You may vary section depth — write more where it matters, less where it doesn't.

## Headline
One punchy sentence (max 15 words) capturing the day's essential character.

## Day Story
2-3 sentences narrating the arc: what was being built or solved, how it evolved, what was discovered. Tell what changed from morning to evening.

## Mindset
1 sentence characterizing the working mode — exploring, building, debugging, synthesizing, learning? What energy or cognitive style drove the day?

## TLDR
2-3 sentences for future recall: key accomplishment, main learning, and what this day unlocks or sets up next.

## Work Patterns
Bullet list. 1-3 behavioral observations (e.g. "sustained 3-hour focus block on auth", "frequent context switches between research and implementation").

## Notable
Bullet list. 2-4 things worth linking to other notes: interesting searches, apparent pivots, decisions made, cross-domain signals.

## Learnings
Bullet list. 2-4 concrete things understood today that can be applied later — skills grasped, patterns recognized, capabilities gained.

## Remember
Bullet list. 3-5 specific things worth quick future recall: commands that worked, configurations found, key resource names, approaches that succeeded or failed.

## Connections
1-2 sentences linking different activities: searches that led to commits, research that informed implementation, topics that bridged domains.

## Questions
1-2 genuinely open questions a thoughtful observer would ask. Don't presuppose emotions or outcomes. Focus on "why" behind patterns, not just "what happened next."

## Note Seeds
Bullet list. 2-4 topics from today that deserve their own permanent note — concepts that came up repeatedly or represent key learning moments.
