## Required Screenshots

### 1. `daily-digest-hero.png` — Hero / Overview Shot
**File:** `2025-06-18.md`
**What to capture:** Full page from the title ("Wednesday, June 18, 2025")
through the end of the Notable section. This is the "above the fold" view a
user sees when they open their daily note.
**Shows:** AI headline, TL;DR summary, themes, stats bar, notable items.
**Framing:** Reading view (not edit mode). ~1200px wide. Obsidian sidebar
collapsed or just barely visible for context.
**Why:** First impression — shows the value proposition at a glance.

### 2. `browser-activity.png` — Categorized Browser History
**File:** `2025-06-18.md`
**What to capture:** The "Browser Activity" section — show at least the
"Dev & Engineering" and "Work" categories with their domain groupings.
**Shows:** Automatic categorization, domain grouping, AI category summaries,
clickable links with timestamps.
**Framing:** Reading view, cropped to just the browser section. ~1200px wide.
**Why:** Shows the core data transformation — raw URLs become organized,
summarized intelligence.

### 3. `searches-and-claude.png` — Search & AI Work Sections
**File:** `2025-06-18.md`
**What to capture:** The Searches section and Claude / AI Work section together.

prompt summaries.
**Framing:** Reading view, cropped to both sections. ~1200px wide.
**Why:** Shows how the plugin captures your research trail and AI conversations.

### 4. `meeting-heavy-day.png` — Mixed / Meeting Day Overview
**File:** `2025-06-19.md`
**What to capture:** Title through Notable section — showing a different kind
of day (meetings + code review + research).
**Shows:** How the plugin adapts its summary to different day types. Different
themes, different activity distribution.
**Framing:** Same as hero shot. ~1200px wide.
**Why:** Demonstrates the plugin works for varied workflows, not just "heads
down coding" days.

### 5. `no-ai-mode.png` — Without AI Summary
**File:** `2025-06-20-no-ai.md`
**What to capture:** Full title + stats line + beginning of Searches section.
**Shows:** Clean output without AI — still useful as a structured activity log.
**Framing:** Reading view. ~1200px wide.
**Why:** Shows the plugin is useful even without an API key. Lowers the barrier
to trying it.

### 6. `settings-panel.png` — Plugin Settings
**What to capture:** The plugin settings panel in Obsidian (Settings > Daily
Digest). Show all sections: General, Data Sources, Limits, AI.
**Shows:** Configurable options — folder, browsers, limits, AI toggle, model
selection.
**Framing:** Obsidian settings modal, ~1000px wide.

existing vault.

## Capture Tips

- **Theme:** Use Obsidian's default theme or "Minimal" for clean screenshots
- **Font:** Default or a clean monospace (JetBrains Mono, SF Mono)
- **Window:** Remove OS chrome if possible (use CleanShot or similar)
- **Resolution:** Capture at 2x (Retina) then export at 1x for crisp images
- **Format:** PNG for UI screenshots, WebP for README (smaller file size)
- **Width:** Target 1200px display width (2400px at 2x)
- **Annotations:** If annotating, use minimal, consistent style (e.g., red
  rounded rectangles for callouts)
